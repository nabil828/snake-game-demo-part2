- Classes and Objects @done
    - game, snake, food @done

- Snake walks! @done
    - add update() for game and snake @done
    - add direction to snake. great the direction enum @done
    - slow down the snake by addig FPS @done

- Snake eats! @done
    - replace x, y for a snake with segmenets. @done
    - update the snake draw(): draw all the segnemnts @done
    - update the snake update() @done
        - update all the segments except the head @done
        - update the head @done
        - test so far by creating a snake of size 3 @done
        - detect collision with food, @done
            - Increase the size of snake by one @done
            - change the location of the food @done

- Game over if we hit the wall or the snake itself @done
    - quit the game vs. rasie an exception @done
    - guard the controls @done
    - guard the draw() and update() @done
    - restart the game @done

- - Auto-pilot
    - Add keyboard controls @done
    - Modify the `Snake` update()
        - update the direction of the head based on the auto-pilot path
            - find a path using BFS path finding algorithm
                - you might need `find_neighbors` helper function
                - you might need `find_valid_neighbor` helper function
            - follow the path based on the direction of the first two segments. This will only change the direction of th head
    
    - Modify the `Snake` draw() to draw
        - visited segments
        - final path
- Display score
